                        Effective water managementand treatment help protect fresh water 
                        ecosystems, preserve boidiversity, and mitigate Environmental 
                        degradation caused by pollution. Wastewater treatment reduces the 
                        amount of pollutants discharged into rivers, lakes and oceans,
                        which helps maintain balance of aquatic ecosystems and prevent
                        spread of harmful substances.
